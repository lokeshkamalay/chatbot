## Download Action

This action will download a package from the Cloudsmith repository in the American Airlines organization. It can be used to retrieve Docker, npm, or other package types as needed. The action simplifies the process of authenticating and downloading packages directly from Cloudsmith.

### Cloudsmith Repository

Always downloads from the appropriate nonprod repository in the American Airlines Cloudsmith organization.
